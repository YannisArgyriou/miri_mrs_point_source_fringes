# miri_mrs_point_source_fringes
This repository shows how a point source fringe correction is derived from MIRI MRS data and applied to MIRI MRS data.  

The code to correct the fringes in a scene with any arbitrary geometric configuration will be made available within the framework of the JWST pipeline.
